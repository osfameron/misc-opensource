=head1 NAME

MooseX::MultiInitArg - Attributes with aliases for constructor arguments.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Thinger;
  use Moose;
    use MooseX::MultiInitArg;
  
  has 'data' => (
            metaclass => 'MultiInitArg',

            # For composability, you could use the following:
            # traits => ['MooseX::MultiInitArg::Trait'],

      is        => 'ro',
      isa       => 'Str',
      init_args => [qw(munge frobnicate)],
  );

  package main;

  # All these are equivalent
  my $foo = Thinger->new(data => 'foo');
  my $foo = Thinger->new(munge => 'foo');
  my $foo = Thinger->new(frobnicate => 'foo');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you've ever wanted to be able to call an attribute any number of things
while you're passing arguments to your object constructor, Now You Can.

The primary motivator is that I have some attributes that were named 
inconsistently, and I wanted to rename them without breaking backwards 
compatibility with my existing API.
